	abstract = {Background: It is important to understand the factors that influence belief formation and belief change.Objective: We test the hypothesis that following belief change about contentious topics, verifying a past belief will influence current beliefs.
Methods: In Experiment 1, participants reported initial beliefs about television violence in a prescreening, then read a belief-inconsistent text in the experiment. Participants either verified or did not verify their initial beliefs before reporting current beliefs. In Experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to verify their initial belief (about gun control effectiveness), a false belief that was the opposite of their initial belief or did not verify a belief.
Results: Participants changed their beliefs after reading a belief-inconsistent text. If participants first verified the beliefs they held several weeks prior to the experiment, they reported their post-reading beliefs as closer to those initial beliefs. In Experiment 2, although 80\% of participants in the false belief condition verified that belief as accurate, it did not influence their post-reading beliefs.
Conclusion: Results show that beliefs were moderated when participants verified their initial beliefs. Results are consistent with the belief fluency hypothesis, which contends that salient information is used in constructing our current beliefs.},

	abstract = {The content of argumentative essays is determined by multiple factors, but belief influences are understudied compared to topic knowledge and argument schema. We investigate how beliefs influence the inclusion of basic components in argumentative writing. A pre-screening survey identified believers and disbelievers in gun control effectiveness. In a subsequent laboratory session, subjects (N = 324) read a one-sided text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Subjects then reported their beliefs and wrote a 250-word argumentative essay explaining them. These essays were coded for the presence or absence of a claim, the number of reasons supporting the claim, the presence of a counterargument, text content, and other factors. 682 supplementary subjects provided approximately 10 ratings for each essay on several factors, including position, clarity, and consideration of both sides. Subjects who read a belief consistent text wrote essays that were more likely to contain a claim, more reasons, and text content. Subjects who read a belief inconsistent text were more likely to include an evaluative statement about the text and to consider both sides of the issue. Individual differences in belief change were related to the likelihood of stating a claim, the number of reasons, and likelihood of mentioning text content. Results suggest that beliefs influence the basic components of argumentation that are included in argumentative essays. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

	abstract = {Ageism can negatively affect everyday interactions with older adults, social policies, healthcare practices, and the physical and cognitive outcomes of aging. Reducing ageism among young adults can improve the lives of older adults and allow for optimal aging. The current study investigates whether a psychology course on aging with a service-learning component can reduce ageism in undergraduate students as measured by the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA). The course is designed to build a comprehensive understanding of aging through in-depth examinations of the aging process and by tying the course objectives to the goals of liberal education. In the service-learning component, students participated in activities with retirement home residents and wrote a literature review on intergenerational interactions along with a reflection on their experience with the residents. Results showed an overall reduction in ageism measured by FSA as well as a significant reduction on each of the three FSA subscales (Antilocution, Discrimination, and Avoidance). This study demonstrates that this holistic approach of teaching aging along with intergenerational interaction can be an effective approach used to change undergraduate students’ attitudes toward aging.},
