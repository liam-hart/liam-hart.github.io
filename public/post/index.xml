      <title>In Preparation: Manuscript on Emotional Autobiographical Memory and NLP</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/forthcoming-paper-memory-nlp/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/forthcoming-paper-memory-nlp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently preparing a first-author manuscript with &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao&lt;/strong&gt; that examines the narrative structure of &lt;strong&gt;emotional autobiographical memories&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults using &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing (NLP)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is part of my ongoing graduate research in the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt; at Georgia Tech and focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;semantic and structural properties of high and low point life narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. The study uses techniques such as topic modeling, entropy scoring, and classification of internal and external details to assess age-related differences in memory representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manuscript builds on prior work by Sheldon et al. (2024) and others, extending their methods to investigate &lt;strong&gt;gist-level representations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;emotional valence&lt;/strong&gt; in autobiographical recall. It contributes to ongoing discussions about how aging affects memory specificity, coherence, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to sharing more about this work as it progresses through peer review. This paper will also serve as the foundation for my &lt;strong&gt;master’s thesis&lt;/strong&gt; and an important step toward my dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/organizing-brownbag-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I organized the &lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Brain Sciences and Aging Brownbag&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/strong&gt;, a research-focused event series highlighting work across aging, cognition, and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This student-led forum brought together graduate students and faculty from across labs and departments to share in-progress work, receive feedback, and foster interdisciplinary dialogue. I was responsible for scheduling speakers, coordinating logistics, and promoting engagement within the Georgia Tech psychology community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing the brownbag helped me build leadership and project management skills while creating space for open and collaborative scientific exchange. It was a rewarding opportunity to support both early-stage researchers and faculty in sharing their ideas and building a research culture grounded in feedback and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>//localhost:1313/post/neuromatch-deep-learning-2025/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/neuromatch-deep-learning-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2025, I completed the &lt;strong&gt;Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning Program&lt;/strong&gt;, an intensive, project-based online course designed to provide a deep understanding of modern machine learning methods, especially in the context of neuroscience and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularization and optimization strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convolutional and recurrent networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative models and reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This training helped solidify my technical foundation in &lt;strong&gt;deep learning&lt;/strong&gt; and equipped me to apply these methods in my research on autobiographical memory narratives. I especially valued the balance of theoretical depth, coding implementation, and collaborative problem-solving with peers across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromatch’s emphasis on accessible, open science aligned with my own goals as a researcher working at the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/starting-first-year-gt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, I officially began my first year as a Ph.D. student in the Psychology program at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Adult Development and Aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first year is focused on building a strong foundation in cognitive aging, emotion, and memory research while also strengthening my skills in natural language processing. I joined the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;m working with Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao on projects involving autobiographical memory narratives — particularly how older adults recall emotional high and low points in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also started exploring how large language models like BERT can be used to examine internal vs. external detail, topic diversity, and gist representation in personal narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging with a new cohort of talented peers, diving into coursework, and beginning to define the focus of my thesis work. It’s been a challenging and inspiring start to what I hope will be a transformative journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Third Publication: Belief Verification and Current Beliefs in The Open Psychology Journal (2024)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I co-authored a publication in &lt;em&gt;The Open Psychology Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Verification of Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project built on a series of studies investigating the cognitive mechanisms involved in belief revision. Specifically, we examined how the process of retrieving and verifying one’s past beliefs can affect present-day belief strength, even in light of conflicting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe, along with G. Russell, T. Williams, and myself. It was part of our broader effort to understand how metacognitive processes—like reflecting on prior knowledge—affect reasoning and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper contributed to the growing literature on belief change and belief coherence, and it offered implications for educational practice, persuasive communication, and critical thinking training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rewarding to see this collaborative work published and to contribute to a line of research that bridges cognition, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/instructional-science-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I published my second first-author paper — this time in &lt;em&gt;Instructional Science&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal that focuses on educational psychology and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Essay Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
was the culmination of a multi-year undergraduate research project I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored how reading persuasive texts influences students’ beliefs and how those belief changes shape the structure, content, and quality of their argumentative writing. The findings provided empirical evidence that shifts in belief can meaningfully influence written expression — an important insight for both cognitive and educational psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marked a major step forward in translating undergraduate research into peer-reviewed work and solidified my commitment to research on cognition, communication, and belief formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the 2021–2022 academic year, I received two undergraduate conference travel grants to support the presentation of my research at academic conferences:
•	🧠 Psi Chi Regional Conference Travel Grant – Awarded $320 to support my poster presentation at the Midwestern Psychological Association Conference in Chicago, where I shared findings on belief change and persuasive reading.
	•	🎓 GVSU Office of Undergraduate Research Conference Travel Grant – Awarded $500 to attend multiple research events, including GVSU Student Scholars Day and the Society for Text and Discourse virtual conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These grants enabled me to attend high-impact academic events, develop presentation skills, network with researchers, and gain experience sharing my work in professional environments. They were important in reinforcing my commitment to research and helped lay the foundation for my academic career.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/excellence-in-discipline-award-gvsu-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I was honored to receive the &lt;strong&gt;Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;, which recognizes one undergraduate student in each major who has demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and disciplinary engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was selected for this award within the &lt;strong&gt;Psychology Department&lt;/strong&gt;, based on my coursework, research contributions, and professional development activities.

      <title>Belief Change and Persuasion: Poster Presentation at MPA 2022</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/mpa-belief-poster-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/mpa-belief-poster-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I presented a poster at the &lt;strong&gt;Midwestern Psychological Association (MPA) Conference&lt;/strong&gt;, held in Chicago. The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explored how explicitly reminding individuals of their past beliefs affects their current evaluations of persuasive information. The poster was based on research I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe, and it contributed to our broader line of work on belief change, reading comprehension, and persuasive writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of my first in-person academic conferences, and I gained valuable experience discussing research with a broad audience of psychologists and students from across the Midwest. It also reinforced the importance of clear visual communication and thoughtful responses to audience questions — skills I’ve continued to develop in subsequent presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Outstanding Creative Achievement Award for Honors College Capstone (2022)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/creative-achievement-award-podcast-2022/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/creative-achievement-award-podcast-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I was honored to receive the &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Creative Achievement Award&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Frederik Meijer Honors College&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University. This award recognized the top five senior capstone projects across the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project was a podcast series titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perspectives on Psilocybin: The Science and Mysticism of Magic Mushrooms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series explored the historical, cultural, and scientific dimensions of psilocybin — from indigenous use and psychedelic therapy to neuroscience and public perception. It blended interviews, academic research, and narrative storytelling to bridge science communication and experiential knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This capstone project allowed me to combine academic inquiry with creative storytelling, sparking what would later become a deeper interest in &lt;strong&gt;transformative experiences&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;self-defining memory&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;interdisciplinary communication&lt;/strong&gt; — all of which continue to influence my graduate research trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was a meaningful affirmation of the value of creative, public-facing scholarship in psychology and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I was awarded the &lt;strong&gt;Robert Hendersen Leadership Award&lt;/strong&gt; by the &lt;strong&gt;Psychology Department at Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;. This departmental honor is presented annually to a student who has demonstrated outstanding leadership, service, and engagement within the academic and campus community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recognition reflected my roles as a &lt;strong&gt;Psi Chi chapter president&lt;/strong&gt;, research mentor, and active member of the undergraduate psychology program.

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-scholars-day-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, I presented a research poster at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt;, a campus-wide event that showcases undergraduate research and creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My presentation was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project examined how prompting individuals to recall their past beliefs before reading persuasive material could influence how strongly they endorse those beliefs afterward. It was part of my work in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; with Dr. Michael Wolfe and complemented our studies on belief revision and argumentative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Scholars Day offered a supportive environment to share work with students, faculty, and staff outside the psychology department. It also gave me an early chance to practice tailoring my research communication for diverse audiences — a skill that has been invaluable throughout my academic path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After graduating from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt; in December 2021, I began working at &lt;strong&gt;Planet Rock&lt;/strong&gt;, a premier climbing gym in Michigan, starting in &lt;strong&gt;January 2022&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Planet Rock, I served as a &lt;strong&gt;staff member and instructor&lt;/strong&gt;, where I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcomed and oriented new climbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught belay and safety classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintained equipment and facility standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fostered a supportive, inclusive climbing community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience deepened my appreciation for &lt;strong&gt;movement, problem-solving, and community building through climbing&lt;/strong&gt;. It also helped me grow in confidence as an educator and communicator — skills that continue to benefit my work in academia and leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/psych-friends-peer-mentor-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2021, I joined &lt;strong&gt;Psych Friends&lt;/strong&gt;, a peer mentoring program in the &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University Department of Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;, as an &lt;strong&gt;upper-division psychology major mentor&lt;/strong&gt;. This program connects experienced psychology students with those newer to the major to foster academic success, well-being, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, I’ve guided mentees on major requirements, career and education paths in psychology, strategies for academic success, and self-care techniques. I’ve also shared insights on the graduate school application process and helped mentees explore the diverse opportunities within the field of psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psych Friends has been a fulfilling experience that aligns with my passion for mentorship and community building. It’s been rewarding to support others in navigating their academic journey, just as I was supported when I started mine. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the growth and success of my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer Scholars Showcase 2021: Belief Change and Persuasion Talk at GVSU</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-summer-scholars-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-summer-scholars-2021/</guid>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/student-summer-scholars-grant-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2021, I was awarded a &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Undergraduate Research&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;.

      <title>Graduating from Grand Valley State University (2021)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-graduation-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-graduation-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2021, I graduated from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;Bachelor of Science in Psychology&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;minor in Applied Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;. My time at GVSU was foundational to my academic and research development — both in and out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at GVSU, I was involved in multiple research projects across psychology and exercise science, earned the &lt;strong&gt;Undergraduate Research Scholar designation&lt;/strong&gt;, and completed a &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt;. I was also honored to receive several awards, including the &lt;strong&gt;Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Robert Hendersen Leadership Award&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Creative Achievement&lt;/strong&gt; from the Honors College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for research on belief, cognition, aging, and emotional memory — and developed a long-term interest in combining psychological science with computational methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GVSU was where I first learned to design studies, analyze data, present at conferences, and write for publication — and it laid the groundwork for everything that followed in graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing Ageism Through Service Learning: Virtual Talk at GVSU Student Scholars Day (2021)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-ageism-virtual-talk-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-ageism-virtual-talk-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2021, I delivered a &lt;strong&gt;virtual talk&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt;, presenting findings from an independent study on educational interventions for reducing ageism in college students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can Ageism Be Reduced by Service Learning Built Into a Lecture-Based Aging Course?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, conducted under the guidance of Dr. Jing Chen, investigated how a lecture course on aging—when paired with service-learning opportunities—impacted students’ attitudes toward older adults. This research combined my interests in gerontology, education, and social attitudes, and was part of a growing body of work aimed at addressing bias through curriculum design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first formal presentation focused on aging and intergenerational attitudes, and it helped solidify my interest in aging research and its relevance to real-world social issues. The experience also helped me adapt to presenting in virtual formats — a skill that became essential during the pandemic years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-exercise-science-poster-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2019, during my first year as an undergraduate at Grand Valley State University, I participated in &lt;strong&gt;Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt; as a co-author on a research poster in the &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Science Lab&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working under the mentorship of faculty in the Exercise Science program, I helped collect and analyze data examining how various warm-up interventions influenced athletic performance. This early exposure to the research process gave me foundational skills in study design, teamwork, and public presentation — all of which proved valuable as I transitioned into cognitive psychology research later in my undergraduate career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although outside my current academic focus, this project introduced me to the world of empirical inquiry and shaped my confidence in pursuing more complex research in later years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/starting-undergrad-research-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2018, I began my first research experience as an undergraduate student at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;, joining the &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Science Lab&lt;/strong&gt; during my first year on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, titled &lt;em&gt;“The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output,”&lt;/em&gt; investigated how warm-up interventions influence athletic performance. I contributed to data collection, participant coordination, and experimental setup — all of which gave me early exposure to the scientific method and the collaborative nature of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my academic interests would later shift toward psychology and cognitive science, this experience was a formative milestone. It helped me build confidence in asking research questions, thinking critically about experimental design, and presenting findings — skills that would become central to my later work in psychology, aging, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also my first experience presenting research publicly at GVSU’s Student Scholars Day in 2019 — an event that helped launch my passion for research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
