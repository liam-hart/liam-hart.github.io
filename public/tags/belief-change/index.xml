      <title>Third Publication: Belief Verification and Current Beliefs in The Open Psychology Journal (2024)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I co-authored a publication in &lt;em&gt;The Open Psychology Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Verification of Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project built on a series of studies investigating the cognitive mechanisms involved in belief revision. Specifically, we examined how the process of retrieving and verifying one’s past beliefs can affect present-day belief strength, even in light of conflicting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe, along with G. Russell, T. Williams, and myself. It was part of our broader effort to understand how metacognitive processes—like reflecting on prior knowledge—affect reasoning and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper contributed to the growing literature on belief change and belief coherence, and it offered implications for educational practice, persuasive communication, and critical thinking training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rewarding to see this collaborative work published and to contribute to a line of research that bridges cognition, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Second First-Author Publication: Argumentative Writing and Belief Change in Instructional Science (2024)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/instructional-science-2024/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/instructional-science-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I published my second first-author paper — this time in &lt;em&gt;Instructional Science&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal that focuses on educational psychology and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Essay Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
was the culmination of a multi-year undergraduate research project I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored how reading persuasive texts influences students’ beliefs and how those belief changes shape the structure, content, and quality of their argumentative writing. The findings provided empirical evidence that shifts in belief can meaningfully influence written expression — an important insight for both cognitive and educational psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marked a major step forward in translating undergraduate research into peer-reviewed work and solidified my commitment to research on cognition, communication, and belief formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Presenting at the Society for Text and Discourse: Beliefs and Argumentative Writing (2022)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/society-text-discourse-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/society-text-discourse-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2022, I delivered my first oral presentation at an academic conference — the &lt;strong&gt;Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse&lt;/strong&gt;. This event, held virtually that year, brought together scholars interested in reading, discourse, and communication processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Belief Change After Reading Predicts Argumentative Essay Content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research emerged from my work as an undergraduate researcher in the Social Cognition Lab at Grand Valley State University, under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Wolfe. We examined how changes in students&amp;rsquo; beliefs after reading persuasive texts influenced the structure and content of their argumentative essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting at this conference was an incredibly formative experience. It helped me build confidence in communicating my research, fielding questions from experts, and engaging with a broader academic community. It also affirmed my interest in pursuing graduate research in cognition, memory, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation was an early but pivotal step on my academic path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Belief Change and Persuasion: Poster Presentation at MPA 2022</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/mpa-belief-poster-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2022 13:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/mpa-belief-poster-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I presented a poster at the &lt;strong&gt;Midwestern Psychological Association (MPA) Conference&lt;/strong&gt;, held in Chicago. The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explored how explicitly reminding individuals of their past beliefs affects their current evaluations of persuasive information. The poster was based on research I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe, and it contributed to our broader line of work on belief change, reading comprehension, and persuasive writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of my first in-person academic conferences, and I gained valuable experience discussing research with a broad audience of psychologists and students from across the Midwest. It also reinforced the importance of clear visual communication and thoughtful responses to audience questions — skills I’ve continued to develop in subsequent presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student Summer Scholars Grant Awarded for Belief Change Research (2021)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/student-summer-scholars-grant-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/student-summer-scholars-grant-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2021, I was awarded a &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Undergraduate Research&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;. This competitive award provided funding and mentorship for students conducting independent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My funded project, titled&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Changes in Past Beliefs Influence Current Beliefs?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt;. It explored how prompting participants to reflect on their prior beliefs before reading persuasive texts impacted their current belief endorsement and argumentative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant provided $7,750 in support and included faculty mentorship, presentation opportunities, and professional development workshops. The project culminated in a formal talk at the GVSU Summer Scholars Showcase and served as the foundation for multiple future conference presentations and publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience was a major stepping stone in my development as a researcher and gave me the confidence and skills that ultimately shaped my path toward graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
