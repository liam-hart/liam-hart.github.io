      <title>Second First-Author Publication: Argumentative Writing and Belief Change in Instructional Science (2024)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I published my second first-author paper â€” this time in &lt;em&gt;Instructional Science&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal that focuses on educational psychology and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Essay Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
was the culmination of a multi-year undergraduate research project I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored how reading persuasive texts influences studentsâ€™ beliefs and how those belief changes shape the structure, content, and quality of their argumentative writing. The findings provided empirical evidence that shifts in belief can meaningfully influence written expression â€” an important insight for both cognitive and educational psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marked a major step forward in translating undergraduate research into peer-reviewed work and solidified my commitment to research on cognition, communication, and belief formation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First First-Author Publication: Educational Gerontology (2023)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/first-publication-educational-gerontology/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2023, I had the honor of publishing my first first-author paper in &lt;em&gt;Educational Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, based on research I conducted as an undergraduate student at Grand Valley State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study explored whether a lecture-based aging course with a service-learning component could positively influence college students&amp;rsquo; attitudes toward older adults. I worked closely with Dr. Jing Chen to design and analyze the project, which was inspired by our shared interest in reducing ageism through educational interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing this paper marked a major personal and professional milestone. It taught me how to take a project from early design through peer review and helped build the foundation for my continued research focus on aging, emotion, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the paper here:&lt;br&gt;
ðŸ“„ &lt;em&gt;Can a course on aging with a service-learning component change studentsâ€™ attitudes toward aging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Published in &lt;em&gt;Educational Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
