      <title>Starting My First Year as a Ph.D. Student at Georgia Tech</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, I officially began my first year as a Ph.D. student in the Psychology program at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Adult Development and Aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first year is focused on building a strong foundation in cognitive aging, emotion, and memory research while also strengthening my skills in natural language processing. I joined the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;m working with Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao on projects involving autobiographical memory narratives — particularly how older adults recall emotional high and low points in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also started exploring how large language models like BERT can be used to examine internal vs. external detail, topic diversity, and gist representation in personal narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging with a new cohort of talented peers, diving into coursework, and beginning to define the focus of my thesis work. It’s been a challenging and inspiring start to what I hope will be a transformative journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to what’s ahead!&lt;/p&gt;
