      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I was honored to receive the &lt;strong&gt;Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;, which recognizes one undergraduate student in each major who has demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and disciplinary engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was selected for this award within the &lt;strong&gt;Psychology Department&lt;/strong&gt;, based on my coursework, research contributions, and professional development activities. At the time, I was actively engaged in multiple research projects and had recently presented at both campus and regional conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recognition was a meaningful capstone to my undergraduate work. It reflected not only academic success but also the mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on experiences that shaped my growth as a student and emerging researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving this award gave me further confidence as I prepared to transition to graduate school and pursue more advanced research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
