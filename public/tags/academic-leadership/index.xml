      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I organized the &lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Brain Sciences and Aging Brownbag&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/strong&gt;, a research-focused event series highlighting work across aging, cognition, and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This student-led forum brought together graduate students and faculty from across labs and departments to share in-progress work, receive feedback, and foster interdisciplinary dialogue. I was responsible for scheduling speakers, coordinating logistics, and promoting engagement within the Georgia Tech psychology community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing the brownbag helped me build leadership and project management skills while creating space for open and collaborative scientific exchange. It was a rewarding opportunity to support both early-stage researchers and faculty in sharing their ideas and building a research culture grounded in feedback and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
