      <title>In Preparation: Manuscript on Emotional Autobiographical Memory and NLP</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/forthcoming-paper-memory-nlp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m currently preparing a first-author manuscript with &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao&lt;/strong&gt; that examines the narrative structure of &lt;strong&gt;emotional autobiographical memories&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults using &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing (NLP)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is part of my ongoing graduate research in the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt; at Georgia Tech and focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;semantic and structural properties of high and low point life narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. The study uses techniques such as topic modeling, entropy scoring, and classification of internal and external details to assess age-related differences in memory representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manuscript builds on prior work by Sheldon et al. (2024) and others, extending their methods to investigate &lt;strong&gt;gist-level representations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;emotional valence&lt;/strong&gt; in autobiographical recall. It contributes to ongoing discussions about how aging affects memory specificity, coherence, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to sharing more about this work as it progresses through peer review. This paper will also serve as the foundation for my &lt;strong&gt;masterâ€™s thesis&lt;/strong&gt; and an important step toward my dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First First-Author Publication: Educational Gerontology (2023)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/first-publication-educational-gerontology/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2023, I had the honor of publishing my first first-author paper in &lt;em&gt;Educational Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, based on research I conducted as an undergraduate student at Grand Valley State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study explored whether a lecture-based aging course with a service-learning component could positively influence college students&amp;rsquo; attitudes toward older adults. I worked closely with Dr. Jing Chen to design and analyze the project, which was inspired by our shared interest in reducing ageism through educational interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing this paper marked a major personal and professional milestone. It taught me how to take a project from early design through peer review and helped build the foundation for my continued research focus on aging, emotion, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the paper here:&lt;br&gt;
ðŸ“„ &lt;em&gt;Can a course on aging with a service-learning component change studentsâ€™ attitudes toward aging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Published in &lt;em&gt;Educational Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
