      <title>Third Publication: Belief Verification and Current Beliefs in The Open Psychology Journal (2024)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I co-authored a publication in &lt;em&gt;The Open Psychology Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Verification of Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project built on a series of studies investigating the cognitive mechanisms involved in belief revision. Specifically, we examined how the process of retrieving and verifying one’s past beliefs can affect present-day belief strength, even in light of conflicting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe, along with G. Russell, T. Williams, and myself. It was part of our broader effort to understand how metacognitive processes—like reflecting on prior knowledge—affect reasoning and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper contributed to the growing literature on belief change and belief coherence, and it offered implications for educational practice, persuasive communication, and critical thinking training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rewarding to see this collaborative work published and to contribute to a line of research that bridges cognition, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Second First-Author Publication: Argumentative Writing and Belief Change in Instructional Science (2024)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I published my second first-author paper — this time in &lt;em&gt;Instructional Science&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal that focuses on educational psychology and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Essay Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
was the culmination of a multi-year undergraduate research project I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored how reading persuasive texts influences students’ beliefs and how those belief changes shape the structure, content, and quality of their argumentative writing. The findings provided empirical evidence that shifts in belief can meaningfully influence written expression — an important insight for both cognitive and educational psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marked a major step forward in translating undergraduate research into peer-reviewed work and solidified my commitment to research on cognition, communication, and belief formation.&lt;/p&gt;
