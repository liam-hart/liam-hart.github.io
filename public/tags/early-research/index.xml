      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2019, during my first year as an undergraduate at Grand Valley State University, I participated in &lt;strong&gt;Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt; as a co-author on a research poster in the &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Science Lab&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working under the mentorship of faculty in the Exercise Science program, I helped collect and analyze data examining how various warm-up interventions influenced athletic performance. This early exposure to the research process gave me foundational skills in study design, teamwork, and public presentation â€” all of which proved valuable as I transitioned into cognitive psychology research later in my undergraduate career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although outside my current academic focus, this project introduced me to the world of empirical inquiry and shaped my confidence in pursuing more complex research in later years.&lt;/p&gt;
