      <title>In Preparation: Manuscript on Emotional Autobiographical Memory and NLP</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/forthcoming-paper-memory-nlp/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/forthcoming-paper-memory-nlp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently preparing a first-author manuscript with &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao&lt;/strong&gt; that examines the narrative structure of &lt;strong&gt;emotional autobiographical memories&lt;/strong&gt; in older adults using &lt;strong&gt;natural language processing (NLP)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is part of my ongoing graduate research in the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt; at Georgia Tech and focuses on the &lt;strong&gt;semantic and structural properties of high and low point life narratives&lt;/strong&gt;. The study uses techniques such as topic modeling, entropy scoring, and classification of internal and external details to assess age-related differences in memory representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manuscript builds on prior work by Sheldon et al. (2024) and others, extending their methods to investigate &lt;strong&gt;gist-level representations&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;emotional valence&lt;/strong&gt; in autobiographical recall. It contributes to ongoing discussions about how aging affects memory specificity, coherence, and emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to sharing more about this work as it progresses through peer review. This paper will also serve as the foundation for my &lt;strong&gt;master’s thesis&lt;/strong&gt; and an important step toward my dissertation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/organizing-brownbag-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2025, I organized the &lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Brain Sciences and Aging Brownbag&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/strong&gt;, a research-focused event series highlighting work across aging, cognition, and neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This student-led forum brought together graduate students and faculty from across labs and departments to share in-progress work, receive feedback, and foster interdisciplinary dialogue. I was responsible for scheduling speakers, coordinating logistics, and promoting engagement within the Georgia Tech psychology community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizing the brownbag helped me build leadership and project management skills while creating space for open and collaborative scientific exchange. It was a rewarding opportunity to support both early-stage researchers and faculty in sharing their ideas and building a research culture grounded in feedback and conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Completed the Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning Program (2025)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/neuromatch-deep-learning-2025/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/neuromatch-deep-learning-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2025, I completed the &lt;strong&gt;Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning Program&lt;/strong&gt;, an intensive, project-based online course designed to provide a deep understanding of modern machine learning methods, especially in the context of neuroscience and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program covered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularization and optimization strategies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convolutional and recurrent networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative models and reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This training helped solidify my technical foundation in &lt;strong&gt;deep learning&lt;/strong&gt; and equipped me to apply these methods in my research on autobiographical memory narratives. I especially valued the balance of theoretical depth, coding implementation, and collaborative problem-solving with peers across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromatch’s emphasis on accessible, open science aligned with my own goals as a researcher working at the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming a Trip Leader for Outdoor Recreation at Georgia Tech (2025)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/trip-leader-outdoor-rec-gt-2025/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/trip-leader-outdoor-rec-gt-2025/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, I became a &lt;strong&gt;Trip Leader for Outdoor Recreation at Georgia Tech&lt;/strong&gt;, a role that combines outdoor education, leadership development, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a trip leader, I help plan and guide excursions such as &lt;strong&gt;rock climbing trips&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;day hikes&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;overnight adventures&lt;/strong&gt; across Georgia and the southeastern U.S. The position involves risk management, technical instruction, group facilitation, and logistics — all while fostering inclusivity and confidence in outdoor spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience has been both personally meaningful and professionally relevant. It has improved my leadership, adaptability, and communication — qualities that translate well to academic teamwork, teaching, and research coordination. It’s also provided balance and renewal alongside the demands of graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outdoor leadership has become a core part of my identity, and I value the opportunity to help others connect with nature, challenge themselves, and grow through shared adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>//localhost:1313/post/henry-ford-symposium-2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2024 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/henry-ford-symposium-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2024, I presented a research poster at the &lt;strong&gt;Henry Ford Health Annual Research Symposium&lt;/strong&gt;, based on my work as a Clinical Research Coordinator in the Department of Otolaryngology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poster was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Effects of a Brief Cognitive Behavioral Treatment vs Attention Control for Body Image-Related Distress Among Head and Neck Cancer Survivors: A Multi-Site RCT.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was a randomized controlled trial comparing a brief CBT intervention to an attention control condition, aimed at reducing distress related to appearance changes following cancer treatment. I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team across several institutions, contributing to data collection, protocol fidelity, and patient coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting at this internal symposium gave me the chance to share results with clinicians, researchers, and trainees, and to see how local innovations in patient-centered research were making an impact across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience deepened my interest in clinical trials and behavioral intervention research, especially where psychological science meets real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/starting-first-year-gt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, I officially began my first year as a Ph.D. student in the Psychology program at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Adult Development and Aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first year is focused on building a strong foundation in cognitive aging, emotion, and memory research while also strengthening my skills in natural language processing. I joined the &lt;strong&gt;Janus Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;m working with Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao on projects involving autobiographical memory narratives — particularly how older adults recall emotional high and low points in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also started exploring how large language models like BERT can be used to examine internal vs. external detail, topic diversity, and gist representation in personal narratives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond research, I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed engaging with a new cohort of talented peers, diving into coursework, and beginning to define the focus of my thesis work. It’s been a challenging and inspiring start to what I hope will be a transformative journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to what’s ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AHNS at COSM 2024: Socioeconomic Factors and Equity in PROM Completion</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/ahns-cosm-equity-proms-2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/ahns-cosm-equity-proms-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, I presented a second clinical research poster at the &lt;strong&gt;American Head and Neck Society (AHNS)&lt;/strong&gt; track at &lt;strong&gt;COSM – Combined Otolaryngology Spring Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;. This work was conducted with the research team at &lt;strong&gt;Henry Ford Health&lt;/strong&gt; and focused on equity in cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poster, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Socioeconomic Factors Impacting Equity in Completion of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures Among Patients with Head and Neck Cancer,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
investigated how variables like income, insurance status, and digital access affected PROM completion rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contributed to the data analysis and presentation development alongside collaborators including Dr. Samantha Tam and colleagues across multiple institutions. This work reinforced the need to consider structural barriers in patient engagement and helped me appreciate the broader context of behavioral and psychosocial research within clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COSM was a dynamic, interdisciplinary venue — and presenting our findings there gave me the opportunity to engage with experts in otolaryngology, behavioral medicine, and implementation science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I co-presented a research poster at the &lt;strong&gt;American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) Annual Meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, based on work conducted during my time as a Clinical Research Coordinator at &lt;strong&gt;Henry Ford Health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poster was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Enhancing PROM Engagement: A Mixed Methods Approach to Reminder Interventions and Patient Preferences in Head and Neck Cancer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project was part of the &lt;strong&gt;BRIGHT Trial&lt;/strong&gt;, led by Dr. Samantha Tam, and aimed to identify strategies for improving completion rates and patient satisfaction with electronic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). My role involved coordinating study visits, managing REDCap data, and contributing to qualitative data synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation marked my first experience disseminating clinical research at a national conference. It offered an important perspective on translational science, bridging patient-centered care and behavioral health research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participating in this work expanded my methodological skills and deepened my appreciation for research that directly impacts patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Third Publication: Belief Verification and Current Beliefs in The Open Psychology Journal (2024)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/open-psychology-journal-2024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2024, I co-authored a publication in &lt;em&gt;The Open Psychology Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Verification of Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project built on a series of studies investigating the cognitive mechanisms involved in belief revision. Specifically, we examined how the process of retrieving and verifying one’s past beliefs can affect present-day belief strength, even in light of conflicting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work was done in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe, along with G. Russell, T. Williams, and myself. It was part of our broader effort to understand how metacognitive processes—like reflecting on prior knowledge—affect reasoning and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper contributed to the growing literature on belief change and belief coherence, and it offered implications for educational practice, persuasive communication, and critical thinking training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was rewarding to see this collaborative work published and to contribute to a line of research that bridges cognition, memory, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, I published my second first-author paper — this time in &lt;em&gt;Instructional Science&lt;/em&gt;, a peer-reviewed journal that focuses on educational psychology and learning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Essay Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
was the culmination of a multi-year undergraduate research project I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored how reading persuasive texts influences students’ beliefs and how those belief changes shape the structure, content, and quality of their argumentative writing. The findings provided empirical evidence that shifts in belief can meaningfully influence written expression — an important insight for both cognitive and educational psychologists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication marked a major step forward in translating undergraduate research into peer-reviewed work and solidified my commitment to research on cognition, communication, and belief formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hugoblox.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo Blox Builder&lt;/a&gt; is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video&#34;&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:&lt;/p&gt;


    
    &lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2vj0WcvH5c?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;
      &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youtube&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilibili&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; bilibili id=&amp;quot;BV1WV4y1r7DF&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video file&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your &lt;code&gt;assets/media/&lt;/code&gt; media library or in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;page&amp;rsquo;s folder&lt;/a&gt;, and then embedding them with the &lt;em&gt;video&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; video src=&amp;quot;my_video.mp4&amp;quot; controls=&amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;podcast&#34;&gt;Podcast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page&amp;rsquo;s folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the &lt;em&gt;audio&lt;/em&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; audio src=&amp;quot;ambient-piano.mp3&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out:&lt;/p&gt;








  








&lt;audio controls &gt;
  &lt;source src=&#34;//localhost:1313/teaching/python/ambient-piano.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-students&#34;&gt;Test students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the &lt;code&gt;spoiler&lt;/code&gt; shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;na&#34;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;👉 Click to view the solution&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;You found me!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;{{&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nt&#34;&gt;spoiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;details class=&#34;spoiler &#34;  id=&#34;spoiler-2&#34;&gt;
  &lt;summary class=&#34;cursor-pointer&#34;&gt;👉 Click to view the solution&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;rounded-lg bg-neutral-50 dark:bg-neutral-800 p-2&#34;&gt;
    You found me 🎉
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;flex px-4 py-3 mb-6 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900&#34;&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;pr-3 pt-1 text-primary-600 dark:text-primary-300&#34;&gt;
  &lt;svg height=&#34;24&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewBox=&#34;0 0 24 24&#34;&gt;&lt;path fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke=&#34;currentColor&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-linejoin=&#34;round&#34; stroke-width=&#34;1.5&#34; d=&#34;m11.25 11.25l.041-.02a.75.75 0 0 1 1.063.852l-.708 2.836a.75.75 0 0 0 1.063.853l.041-.021M21 12a9 9 0 1 1-18 0a9 9 0 0 1 18 0m-9-3.75h.008v.008H12z&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;dark:text-neutral-300&#34;&gt;We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34; data-lang=&#34;latex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;sb&#34;&gt;$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\gamma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\frac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;} &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^T &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; x_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; |}{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\nabla&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\mathbf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{x}_{n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nv&#34;&gt;\|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo&amp;rsquo;s Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Presenting at the Midwest Cognitive Science Conference: Argumentative Writing and Belief Change (2023)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/midwest-cogsci-2023/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/midwest-cogsci-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2023, I presented a research poster at the &lt;strong&gt;Midwest Cognitive Science Conference&lt;/strong&gt;, expanding on work I had previously shared at the Society for Text and Discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poster, titled &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beliefs Influence Argumentative Writing,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; continued our investigation into how belief change following persuasive reading impacts the way people write argumentative essays. This project was part of my ongoing work in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University, led by Dr. Michael Wolfe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference offered an exciting opportunity to engage with researchers from across the region, share findings in a more interactive format, and refine how I communicated the practical implications of our study. It also marked one of my final undergraduate research milestones before graduating and heading to graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like this helped me solidify my identity as a researcher and gave me valuable experience presenting in academic spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Research Coordinator on the BRIGHT Study at Henry Ford Health (2023)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/bright-study-henry-ford-health-2023/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/bright-study-henry-ford-health-2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2023, I began working as a &lt;strong&gt;Research Coordinator&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Henry Ford Health&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;BRIGHT Study (Building Resilience in Girls&amp;rsquo; Health Today)&lt;/strong&gt; — a large, longitudinal research project examining &lt;strong&gt;mental health, trauma exposure, and resilience&lt;/strong&gt; in youth populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BRIGHT Study involves multi-wave data collection, including clinical interviews, cognitive assessments, and biological sampling, with a focus on trauma-exposed girls aged 11–17. As a coordinator, I was responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participant scheduling and informed consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Administering and scoring assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing REDCap data and IRB documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coordinating with clinicians, research staff, and school partners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring ethical and culturally sensitive practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience offered firsthand insight into &lt;strong&gt;community-based clinical research&lt;/strong&gt; and strengthened my skills in data management, participant rapport, and trauma-informed care. It also affirmed my interest in &lt;strong&gt;lifespan development&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;emotional memory&lt;/strong&gt;, and the ways research can inform interventions and public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My time on the BRIGHT Study was foundational in preparing for graduate-level work and deepening my commitment to research that supports vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/first-publication-educational-gerontology/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2023, I had the honor of publishing my first first-author paper in &lt;em&gt;Educational Gerontology&lt;/em&gt;, based on research I conducted as an undergraduate student at Grand Valley State University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study explored whether a lecture-based aging course with a service-learning component could positively influence college students&amp;rsquo; attitudes toward older adults. I worked closely with Dr. Jing Chen to design and analyze the project, which was inspired by our shared interest in reducing ageism through educational interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing this paper marked a major personal and professional milestone. It taught me how to take a project from early design through peer review and helped build the foundation for my continued research focus on aging, emotion, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the paper here:&lt;br&gt;
📄 &lt;em&gt;Can a course on aging with a service-learning component change students’ attitudes toward aging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Presenting at the Society for Text and Discourse: Beliefs and Argumentative Writing (2022)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/society-text-discourse-2022/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 14:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/society-text-discourse-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2022, I delivered my first oral presentation at an academic conference — the &lt;strong&gt;Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse&lt;/strong&gt;. This event, held virtually that year, brought together scholars interested in reading, discourse, and communication processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Belief Change After Reading Predicts Argumentative Essay Content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research emerged from my work as an undergraduate researcher in the Social Cognition Lab at Grand Valley State University, under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Wolfe. We examined how changes in students&amp;rsquo; beliefs after reading persuasive texts influenced the structure and content of their argumentative essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting at this conference was an incredibly formative experience. It helped me build confidence in communicating my research, fielding questions from experts, and engaging with a broader academic community. It also affirmed my interest in pursuing graduate research in cognition, memory, and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation was an early but pivotal step on my academic path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/excellence-in-discipline-award-gvsu-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I was honored to receive the &lt;strong&gt;Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;, which recognizes one undergraduate student in each major who has demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and disciplinary engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was selected for this award within the &lt;strong&gt;Psychology Department&lt;/strong&gt;, based on my coursework, research contributions, and professional development activities. At the time, I was actively engaged in multiple research projects and had recently presented at both campus and regional conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recognition was a meaningful capstone to my undergraduate work. It reflected not only academic success but also the mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on experiences that shaped my growth as a student and emerging researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving this award gave me further confidence as I prepared to transition to graduate school and pursue more advanced research opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/mpa-belief-poster-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I presented a poster at the &lt;strong&gt;Midwestern Psychological Association (MPA) Conference&lt;/strong&gt;, held in Chicago. The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study explored how explicitly reminding individuals of their past beliefs affects their current evaluations of persuasive information. The poster was based on research I conducted in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe, and it contributed to our broader line of work on belief change, reading comprehension, and persuasive writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of my first in-person academic conferences, and I gained valuable experience discussing research with a broad audience of psychologists and students from across the Midwest. It also reinforced the importance of clear visual communication and thoughtful responses to audience questions — skills I’ve continued to develop in subsequent presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/creative-achievement-award-podcast-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I was honored to receive the &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Creative Achievement Award&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Frederik Meijer Honors College&lt;/strong&gt; at Grand Valley State University. This award recognized the top five senior capstone projects across the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project was a podcast series titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Perspectives on Psilocybin: The Science and Mysticism of Magic Mushrooms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series explored the historical, cultural, and scientific dimensions of psilocybin — from indigenous use and psychedelic therapy to neuroscience and public perception. It blended interviews, academic research, and narrative storytelling to bridge science communication and experiential knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This capstone project allowed me to combine academic inquiry with creative storytelling, sparking what would later become a deeper interest in &lt;strong&gt;transformative experiences&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;self-defining memory&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;interdisciplinary communication&lt;/strong&gt; — all of which continue to influence my graduate research trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was a meaningful affirmation of the value of creative, public-facing scholarship in psychology and cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2022, I was awarded the &lt;strong&gt;Robert Hendersen Leadership Award&lt;/strong&gt; by the &lt;strong&gt;Psychology Department at Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;. This departmental honor is presented annually to a student who has demonstrated outstanding leadership, service, and engagement within the academic and campus community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recognition reflected my roles as a &lt;strong&gt;Psi Chi chapter president&lt;/strong&gt;, research mentor, and active member of the undergraduate psychology program.

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-scholars-day-2022/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2022, I presented a research poster at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt;, a campus-wide event that showcases undergraduate research and creative work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My presentation was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project examined how prompting individuals to recall their past beliefs before reading persuasive material could influence how strongly they endorse those beliefs afterward. It was part of my work in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; with Dr. Michael Wolfe and complemented our studies on belief revision and argumentative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student Scholars Day offered a supportive environment to share work with students, faculty, and staff outside the psychology department. It also gave me an early chance to practice tailoring my research communication for diverse audiences — a skill that has been invaluable throughout my academic path.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After graduating from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt; in December 2021, I began working at &lt;strong&gt;Planet Rock&lt;/strong&gt;, a premier climbing gym in Michigan, starting in &lt;strong&gt;January 2022&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Planet Rock, I served as a &lt;strong&gt;staff member and instructor&lt;/strong&gt;, where I:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Welcomed and oriented new climbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taught belay and safety classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintained equipment and facility standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fostered a supportive, inclusive climbing community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience deepened my appreciation for &lt;strong&gt;movement, problem-solving, and community building through climbing&lt;/strong&gt;. It also helped me grow in confidence as an educator and communicator — skills that continue to benefit my work in academia and leadership roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planet Rock was more than a job; it was a bridge between undergraduate life and my next chapter in research and graduate training.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/psych-friends-peer-mentor-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2021, I joined &lt;strong&gt;Psych Friends&lt;/strong&gt;, a peer mentoring program in the &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University Department of Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;, as an &lt;strong&gt;upper-division psychology major mentor&lt;/strong&gt;. This program connects experienced psychology students with those newer to the major to foster academic success, well-being, and a sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a mentor, I’ve guided mentees on major requirements, career and education paths in psychology, strategies for academic success, and self-care techniques. I’ve also shared insights on the graduate school application process and helped mentees explore the diverse opportunities within the field of psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psych Friends has been a fulfilling experience that aligns with my passion for mentorship and community building. It’s been rewarding to support others in navigating their academic journey, just as I was supported when I started mine. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the growth and success of my peers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the 2021–2022 academic year, I served as &lt;strong&gt;President of the Grand Valley State University chapter of Psi Chi&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;International Honor Society in Psychology&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this role, I led a team of officers in organizing academic and professional development events, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduate school Q&amp;amp;A panels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faculty research spotlights&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community service activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peer mentorship pairings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked closely with our faculty advisor and departmental leadership to support psychology majors and create an inclusive, engaging chapter culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leadership experience helped me grow in confidence, communication, and organizational skill — all of which have continued to shape my professional identity. Psi Chi gave me a valuable platform to support others and stay deeply engaged in the broader psychology community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2021, I presented at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University’s Student Summer Scholars Showcase&lt;/strong&gt;, where I shared the results of my research project funded by a competitive undergraduate research grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My talk, titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
explored how reflecting on previously held beliefs shapes the way individuals respond to persuasive texts and influences their reasoning and writing. This was part of my extended work in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt; with Dr. Michael Wolfe, supported by the &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt; from the Office of Undergraduate Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation was a major milestone in my development as a researcher. It gave me the chance to formally communicate my findings to faculty, administrators, and peers, and marked my first time delivering an academic talk based on independently developed research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience affirmed my desire to pursue graduate study and helped build the skills I continue to use in my current academic and professional presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Summer 2021, I was awarded a &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Undergraduate Research&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;. This competitive award provided funding and mentorship for students conducting independent research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My funded project, titled&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Do Changes in Past Beliefs Influence Current Beliefs?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe in the &lt;strong&gt;Social Cognition Lab&lt;/strong&gt;. It explored how prompting participants to reflect on their prior beliefs before reading persuasive texts impacted their current belief endorsement and argumentative writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grant provided $7,750 in support and included faculty mentorship, presentation opportunities, and professional development workshops. The project culminated in a formal talk at the GVSU Summer Scholars Showcase and served as the foundation for multiple future conference presentations and publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience was a major stepping stone in my development as a researcher and gave me the confidence and skills that ultimately shaped my path toward graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Graduating from Grand Valley State University (2021)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-graduation-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 30 Apr 2021 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-graduation-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2021, I graduated from &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;Bachelor of Science in Psychology&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;minor in Applied Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;. My time at GVSU was foundational to my academic and research development — both in and out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at GVSU, I was involved in multiple research projects across psychology and exercise science, earned the &lt;strong&gt;Undergraduate Research Scholar designation&lt;/strong&gt;, and completed a &lt;strong&gt;Student Summer Scholars Grant&lt;/strong&gt;. I was also honored to receive several awards, including the &lt;strong&gt;Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Robert Hendersen Leadership Award&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding Creative Achievement&lt;/strong&gt; from the Honors College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for research on belief, cognition, aging, and emotional memory — and developed a long-term interest in combining psychological science with computational methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GVSU was where I first learned to design studies, analyze data, present at conferences, and write for publication — and it laid the groundwork for everything that followed in graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reducing Ageism Through Service Learning: Virtual Talk at GVSU Student Scholars Day (2021)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-ageism-virtual-talk-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Apr 2021 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-ageism-virtual-talk-2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2021, I delivered a &lt;strong&gt;virtual talk&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt;, presenting findings from an independent study on educational interventions for reducing ageism in college students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Can Ageism Be Reduced by Service Learning Built Into a Lecture-Based Aging Course?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, conducted under the guidance of Dr. Jing Chen, investigated how a lecture course on aging—when paired with service-learning opportunities—impacted students’ attitudes toward older adults. This research combined my interests in gerontology, education, and social attitudes, and was part of a growing body of work aimed at addressing bias through curriculum design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first formal presentation focused on aging and intergenerational attitudes, and it helped solidify my interest in aging research and its relevance to real-world social issues. The experience also helped me adapt to presenting in virtual formats — a skill that became essential during the pandemic years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Early Research Experience: Exercise Science Poster at GVSU Student Scholars Day (2019)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-exercise-science-poster-2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 Apr 2019 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/gvsu-exercise-science-poster-2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Spring 2019, during my first year as an undergraduate at Grand Valley State University, I participated in &lt;strong&gt;Student Scholars Day&lt;/strong&gt; as a co-author on a research poster in the &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Science Lab&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project was titled:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working under the mentorship of faculty in the Exercise Science program, I helped collect and analyze data examining how various warm-up interventions influenced athletic performance. This early exposure to the research process gave me foundational skills in study design, teamwork, and public presentation — all of which proved valuable as I transitioned into cognitive psychology research later in my undergraduate career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although outside my current academic focus, this project introduced me to the world of empirical inquiry and shaped my confidence in pursuing more complex research in later years.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starting Undergraduate Research at GVSU (2018–2019)</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/post/starting-undergrad-research-2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Oct 2018 09:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <guid>//localhost:1313/post/starting-undergrad-research-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2018, I began my first research experience as an undergraduate student at &lt;strong&gt;Grand Valley State University&lt;/strong&gt;, joining the &lt;strong&gt;Exercise Science Lab&lt;/strong&gt; during my first year on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, titled &lt;em&gt;“The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output,”&lt;/em&gt; investigated how warm-up interventions influence athletic performance. I contributed to data collection, participant coordination, and experimental setup — all of which gave me early exposure to the scientific method and the collaborative nature of research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my academic interests would later shift toward psychology and cognitive science, this experience was a formative milestone. It helped me build confidence in asking research questions, thinking critically about experimental design, and presenting findings — skills that would become central to my later work in psychology, aging, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also my first experience presenting research publicly at GVSU’s Student Scholars Day in 2019 — an event that helped launch my passion for research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
