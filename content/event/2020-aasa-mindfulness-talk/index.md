abstract: |
  Mindfulness can be used to describe a variety of practices and processes that generally involves focusing on the present moment and being conscious and aware. Mindfulness meditation has been shown to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression, so it is likely that it will increase life satisfaction and self-esteem. In this poster, I will propose a study that seeks to determine the effect of mindfulness meditation on life satisfaction and self-esteem in older adults living in retirement homes. Participants will undergo an 8-week mindfulness meditation intervention, following a 10-minute guided meditation 4 times per week and will be encouraged to practice daily. Life satisfaction and self-esteem will be measured before and after the 8-week mindfulness meditation

  *Note.* Unfortunately, this study was canceled due to COVID-19
