abstract: |
  As a recent graduate with a bachelor’s in psychology and applied statistics, Liam will provide an overview of his academic research and reflect on its value for graduate school applications. In his freshman year, Liam began research in an exercise science lab before declaring psychology as a major. In his senior year (2022), Liam was awarded the “Excellence in a Discipline” and the “Robert Hendersen Leadership” awards. Since then, he has engaged in two separate lines of research in social and cognitive psychology which have led to peer-reviewed publications and several manuscripts in progress. As an integral part of his academic journey, Liam will reflect on his participation in the Student Summer Scholars program and discuss the benefits of such programs offered by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (OURS). Liam will discuss the importance of faculty mentorship and how active involvement in a research lab has helped prepare him for graduate school and a career in research.
