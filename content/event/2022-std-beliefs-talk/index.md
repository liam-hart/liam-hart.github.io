  Believers and disbelievers in gun control effectiveness wrote a 250 word essay explaining their beliefs after reading a one-sided text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Essays were coded for number of reasons and the presence or absence of a claim, counterargument, text content, policy claim, metacognitive statement, and evaluative statement about the text. Between group differences in essay characteristics and how they relate as a function of belief change are discussed.
