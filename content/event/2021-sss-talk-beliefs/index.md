abstract: |
  Participants read a gun-control text consistent or inconsistent with beliefs reported weeks earlier. They then verified initial beliefs that were accurate, opposite of actual initial beliefs, or did not verify them (control). Verifying accurate initial beliefs changed current beliefs compared to verifying false initial beliefs or not verifying them.
