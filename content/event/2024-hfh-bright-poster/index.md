abstract: |
  This poster presents a randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) compared to an attention control group in reducing body image-related distress (BID) among head and neck cancer survivors. The BRIGHT intervention was evaluated as a potential standard of care to improve psychosocial morbidity and quality of life in this population. Study outcomes included changes in BID, treatment response profiles, and clinical implementation implications.
