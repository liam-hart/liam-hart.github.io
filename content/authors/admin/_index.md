## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Janus Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/) at Georgia Tech, supervised by [Hsiao-Wen Liao](https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/hsiao-wen-liao). I am fascinated by the human mind, how it might work, and how we can apply what we understand about it to solve real-world problems. 

My research focuses on autobiographical memory and how it develops across the lifespan. Using natural language processing, I integrate qualitative and quantitative methods to examine how people represent meaningful life experiences in memory at different ages. 

Outside of work, I find my greatest joy in [climbing](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201318969/liam-hart) and exploring the natural world.
