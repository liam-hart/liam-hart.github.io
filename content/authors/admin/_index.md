## About Me
I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/">Janus Lab</a> at Georgia Tech, supervised by <a href="https://psychology.gatech.edu/people/hsiao-wen-liao" >Hsiao-Wen Liao</a>. I am fascinated by the human mind, how it might work, and how we can apply what we understand about it to solve real-world problems.

My research focuses on autobiographical memory and how it develops across the lifespan. Using natural language processing, I integrate qualitative and quantitative methods to examine how people represent meaningful life experiences in memory at different ages.

Outside of work, I find my greatest joy in climbing and exploring the natural world.
