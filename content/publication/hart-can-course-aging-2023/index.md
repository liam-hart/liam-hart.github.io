abstract: Ageism can negatively affect everyday interactions with older adults, social
  policies, healthcare practices, and the physical and cognitive outcomes of aging.
  Reducing ageism among young adults can improve the lives of older adults and allow
  for optimal aging. The current study investigates whether a psychology course on
  aging with a service-learning component can reduce ageism in undergraduate students
  as measured by the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA). The course is designed to build
  a comprehensive understanding of aging through in-depth examinations of the aging
  process and by tying the course objectives to the goals of liberal education. In
  the service-learning component, students participated in activities with retirement
  home residents and wrote a literature review on intergenerational interactions along
  with a reflection on their experience with the residents. Results showed an overall
  reduction in ageism measured by FSA as well as a significant reduction on each of
  the three FSA subscales (Antilocution, Discrimination, and Avoidance). This study
  demonstrates that this holistic approach of teaching aging along with intergenerational
  interaction can be an effective approach used to change undergraduate students’
  attitudes toward aging.
