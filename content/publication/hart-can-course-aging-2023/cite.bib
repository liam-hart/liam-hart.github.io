 abstract = {Ageism can negatively affect everyday interactions with older adults, social policies, healthcare practices, and the physical and cognitive outcomes of aging. Reducing ageism among young adults can improve the lives of older adults and allow for optimal aging. The current study investigates whether a psychology course on aging with a service-learning component can reduce ageism in undergraduate students as measured by the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA). The course is designed to build a comprehensive understanding of aging through in-depth examinations of the aging process and by tying the course objectives to the goals of liberal education. In the service-learning component, students participated in activities with retirement home residents and wrote a literature review on intergenerational interactions along with a reflection on their experience with the residents. Results showed an overall reduction in ageism measured by FSA as well as a significant reduction on each of the three FSA subscales (Antilocution, Discrimination, and Avoidance). This study demonstrates that this holistic approach of teaching aging along with intergenerational interaction can be an effective approach used to change undergraduate students’ attitudes toward aging.},
