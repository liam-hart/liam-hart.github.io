abstract: 'Background: It is important to understand the factors that influence belief
  formation and belief change.Objective: We test the hypothesis that following belief
  change about contentious topics, verifying a past belief will influence current
  beliefs. Methods: In Experiment 1, participants reported initial beliefs about television
  violence in a prescreening, then read a belief-inconsistent text in the experiment.
  Participants either verified or did not verify their initial beliefs before reporting
  current beliefs. In Experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to verify
  their initial belief (about gun control effectiveness), a false belief that was
  the opposite of their initial belief or did not verify a belief. Results: Participants
  changed their beliefs after reading a belief-inconsistent text. If participants
  first verified the beliefs they held several weeks prior to the experiment, they
  reported their post-reading beliefs as closer to those initial beliefs. In Experiment
  2, although 80% of participants in the false belief condition verified that belief
  as accurate, it did not influence their post-reading beliefs. Conclusion: Results
  show that beliefs were moderated when participants verified their initial beliefs.
  Results are consistent with the belief fluency hypothesis, which contends that salient
  information is used in constructing our current beliefs.'
