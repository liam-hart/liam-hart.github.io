abstract: The content of argumentative essays is determined by multiple factors, but
  belief influences are understudied compared to topic knowledge and argument schema.
  We investigate how beliefs influence the inclusion of basic components in argumentative
  writing. A pre-screening survey identified believers and disbelievers in gun control
  effectiveness. In a subsequent laboratory session, subjects (N = 324) read a one-sided
  text that was either consistent or inconsistent with their beliefs. Subjects then
  reported their beliefs and wrote a 250-word argumentative essay explaining them.
  These essays were coded for the presence or absence of a claim, the number of reasons
  supporting the claim, the presence of a counterargument, text content, and other
  factors. 682 supplementary subjects provided approximately 10 ratings for each essay
  on several factors, including position, clarity, and consideration of both sides.
  Subjects who read a belief consistent text wrote essays that were more likely to
  contain a claim, more reasons, and text content. Subjects who read a belief inconsistent
  text were more likely to include an evaluative statement about the text and to consider
  both sides of the issue. Individual differences in belief change were related to
  the likelihood of stating a claim, the number of reasons, and likelihood of mentioning
  text content. Results suggest that beliefs influence the basic components of argumentation
  that are included in argumentative essays. Theoretical and practical implications
  of these findings are discussed.
