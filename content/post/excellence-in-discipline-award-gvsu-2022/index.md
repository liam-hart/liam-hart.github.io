In Spring 2022, I was honored to receive the **Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award** from **Grand Valley State University**, which recognizes one undergraduate student in each major who has demonstrated outstanding academic achievement and disciplinary engagement.

I was selected for this award within the **Psychology Department**, based on my coursework, research contributions, and professional development activities. At the time, I was actively engaged in multiple research projects and had recently presented at both campus and regional conferences.

This recognition was a meaningful capstone to my undergraduate work. It reflected not only academic success but also the mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on experiences that shaped my growth as a student and emerging researcher.

Receiving this award gave me further confidence as I prepared to transition to graduate school and pursue more advanced research opportunities.
