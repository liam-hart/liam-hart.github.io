In Summer 2022, I delivered my first oral presentation at an academic conference â€” the **Annual Meeting of the Society for Text and Discourse**. This event, held virtually that year, brought together scholars interested in reading, discourse, and communication processes.

My talk was titled:  
**"Belief Change After Reading Predicts Argumentative Essay Content."**

This research emerged from my work as an undergraduate researcher in the Social Cognition Lab at Grand Valley State University, under the mentorship of Dr. Michael Wolfe. We examined how changes in students' beliefs after reading persuasive texts influenced the structure and content of their argumentative essays.

Presenting at this conference was an incredibly formative experience. It helped me build confidence in communicating my research, fielding questions from experts, and engaging with a broader academic community. It also affirmed my interest in pursuing graduate research in cognition, memory, and language.

This presentation was an early but pivotal step on my academic path.
