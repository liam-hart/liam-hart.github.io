During the 2021–2022 academic year, I served as **President of the Grand Valley State University chapter of Psi Chi**, the **International Honor Society in Psychology**.

In this role, I led a team of officers in organizing academic and professional development events, including:
- Graduate school Q&A panels  
- Faculty research spotlights  
- Community service activities  
- Peer mentorship pairings

I also worked closely with our faculty advisor and departmental leadership to support psychology majors and create an inclusive, engaging chapter culture.

This leadership experience helped me grow in confidence, communication, and organizational skill — all of which have continued to shape my professional identity. Psi Chi gave me a valuable platform to support others and stay deeply engaged in the broader psychology community.
