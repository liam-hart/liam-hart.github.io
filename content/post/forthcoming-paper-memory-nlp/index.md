I’m currently preparing a first-author manuscript with **Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao** that examines the narrative structure of **emotional autobiographical memories** in older adults using **natural language processing (NLP)**.

This project is part of my ongoing graduate research in the **Janus Laboratory** at Georgia Tech and focuses on the **semantic and structural properties of high and low point life narratives**. The study uses techniques such as topic modeling, entropy scoring, and classification of internal and external details to assess age-related differences in memory representation.

The manuscript builds on prior work by Sheldon et al. (2024) and others, extending their methods to investigate **gist-level representations** and **emotional valence** in autobiographical recall. It contributes to ongoing discussions about how aging affects memory specificity, coherence, and emotional processing.

I look forward to sharing more about this work as it progresses through peer review. This paper will also serve as the foundation for my **master’s thesis** and an important step toward my dissertation.
