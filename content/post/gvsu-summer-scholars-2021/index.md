In Summer 2021, I presented at **Grand Valley State University’s Student Summer Scholars Showcase**, where I shared the results of my research project funded by a competitive undergraduate research grant.

My talk, titled:  
**"Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs,"**  
explored how reflecting on previously held beliefs shapes the way individuals respond to persuasive texts and influences their reasoning and writing. This was part of my extended work in the **Social Cognition Lab** with Dr. Michael Wolfe, supported by the **Student Summer Scholars Grant** from the Office of Undergraduate Research.

The presentation was a major milestone in my development as a researcher. It gave me the chance to formally communicate my findings to faculty, administrators, and peers, and marked my first time delivering an academic talk based on independently developed research.

This experience affirmed my desire to pursue graduate study and helped build the skills I continue to use in my current academic and professional presentations.
