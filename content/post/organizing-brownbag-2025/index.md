In 2025, I organized the **Cognitive Brain Sciences and Aging Brownbag** at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, a research-focused event series highlighting work across aging, cognition, and neuroscience.

This student-led forum brought together graduate students and faculty from across labs and departments to share in-progress work, receive feedback, and foster interdisciplinary dialogue. I was responsible for scheduling speakers, coordinating logistics, and promoting engagement within the Georgia Tech psychology community.

Organizing the brownbag helped me build leadership and project management skills while creating space for open and collaborative scientific exchange. It was a rewarding opportunity to support both early-stage researchers and faculty in sharing their ideas and building a research culture grounded in feedback and conversation.
