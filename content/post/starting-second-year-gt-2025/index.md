In Fall 2025, I began my second year as a Ph.D. student in the Psychology program at **Georgia Institute of Technology**, continuing my focus on **Adult Development and Aging**.

After a challenging and rewarding first year of coursework, lab onboarding, and theoretical immersion, year two marks a shift toward deepening my research involvement and preparing my master’s thesis. I’m continuing my work in the **Janus Laboratory** under the mentorship of Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao, analyzing autobiographical memory narratives using NLP techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and detail classification.

In addition to research, I’ve taken on more teaching responsibilities, including serving as a **lab instructor for Cognitive Psychology**. This experience has helped me grow as an educator while reinforcing my understanding of key psychological theories and methods.

As I move forward in the program, I’m especially focused on refining my analytical pipeline, preparing for data collection with younger adults, and identifying the next set of research questions to explore in my doctoral work.

Second year feels like a step closer to independence and clarity — and I’m excited for what lies ahead.
