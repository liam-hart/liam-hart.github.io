In August 2024, I officially began my first year as a Ph.D. student in the Psychology program at Georgia Tech, with a concentration in Adult Development and Aging.

This first year is focused on building a strong foundation in cognitive aging, emotion, and memory research while also strengthening my skills in natural language processing. I joined the **Janus Laboratory**, where I'm working with Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao on projects involving autobiographical memory narratives — particularly how older adults recall emotional high and low points in their lives.

I've also started exploring how large language models like BERT can be used to examine internal vs. external detail, topic diversity, and gist representation in personal narratives.

Beyond research, I've enjoyed engaging with a new cohort of talented peers, diving into coursework, and beginning to define the focus of my thesis work. It’s been a challenging and inspiring start to what I hope will be a transformative journey.

Looking forward to what’s ahead!
