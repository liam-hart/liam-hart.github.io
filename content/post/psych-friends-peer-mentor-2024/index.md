In Fall 2024, I joined **Psych Friends**, a peer mentoring program in the **Georgia Tech School of Psychology**, as a **graduate student mentor**. This program pairs first-year students with second- or third-year mentors to provide guidance, encouragement, and a sense of community during the critical first year of graduate training.

As a mentor, I’ve helped new students navigate course planning, lab dynamics, work-life balance, and professional development. I’ve also shared strategies for finding research direction, building faculty relationships, and adjusting to the culture of graduate school.

Psych Friends has been a rewarding experience that aligns with my broader values around community building and mentorship. I benefited from supportive peers when I was starting out, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to pass that support forward.
