In Spring 2022, I was awarded the **Robert Hendersen Leadership Award** by the **Psychology Department at Grand Valley State University**. This departmental honor is presented annually to a student who has demonstrated outstanding leadership, service, and engagement within the academic and campus community.

This recognition reflected my roles as a **Psi Chi chapter president**, research mentor, and active member of the undergraduate psychology program. I worked to support student scholarship, promote research engagement, and foster an inclusive and collaborative academic environment.

Receiving this award affirmed the importance of leadership beyond academics — emphasizing mentorship, communication, and the ability to build community in research settings. I’m grateful to the faculty and peers who contributed to my growth and success at GVSU.
