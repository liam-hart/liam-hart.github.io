In 2024, I was honored to receive the **President’s Fellowship** from **Georgia Institute of Technology**, awarded to the **top 10 percent of incoming doctoral students** across the Institute.

The fellowship provides four years of supplemental funding and professional development support. It recognizes not only academic and research potential but also leadership and service contributions. For me, it marked a tremendous vote of confidence in my graduate research goals and my commitment to the study of aging, memory, and emotion.

This support has given me the flexibility to pursue interdisciplinary work at the intersection of cognitive psychology and natural language processing, and has allowed me to focus deeply on developing both technical and theoretical expertise.

I’m grateful to Georgia Tech for this opportunity and am working hard to make the most of it.
