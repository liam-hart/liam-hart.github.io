In Spring 2023, I had the honor of publishing my first first-author paper in *Educational Gerontology*, based on research I conducted as an undergraduate student at Grand Valley State University.

The study explored whether a lecture-based aging course with a service-learning component could positively influence college students' attitudes toward older adults. I worked closely with Dr. Jing Chen to design and analyze the project, which was inspired by our shared interest in reducing ageism through educational interventions.

Publishing this paper marked a major personal and professional milestone. It taught me how to take a project from early design through peer review and helped build the foundation for my continued research focus on aging, emotion, and memory.
