In Spring 2025, I completed the **Neuromatch Academy Deep Learning Program**, an intensive, project-based online course designed to provide a deep understanding of modern machine learning methods, especially in the context of neuroscience and cognitive science.

The program covered:
- Fundamentals of neural networks and backpropagation  
- Regularization and optimization strategies  
- Convolutional and recurrent networks  
- Transformer architectures and attention mechanisms  
- Generative models and reinforcement learning

This training helped solidify my technical foundation in **deep learning** and equipped me to apply these methods in my research on autobiographical memory narratives. I especially valued the balance of theoretical depth, coding implementation, and collaborative problem-solving with peers across disciplines.

Neuromatch’s emphasis on accessible, open science aligned with my own goals as a researcher working at the intersection of psychology and artificial intelligence.
