In Spring 2022, I presented a poster at the **Midwestern Psychological Association (MPA) Conference**, held in Chicago. The project was titled:  
**"Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs."**

This study explored how explicitly reminding individuals of their past beliefs affects their current evaluations of persuasive information. The poster was based on research I conducted in the **Social Cognition Lab** at Grand Valley State University with Dr. Michael Wolfe, and it contributed to our broader line of work on belief change, reading comprehension, and persuasive writing.

This was one of my first in-person academic conferences, and I gained valuable experience discussing research with a broad audience of psychologists and students from across the Midwest. It also reinforced the importance of clear visual communication and thoughtful responses to audience questions — skills I’ve continued to develop in subsequent presentations.
