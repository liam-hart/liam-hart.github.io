In April 2022, I presented a research poster at **Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day**, a campus-wide event that showcases undergraduate research and creative work.

My presentation was titled:  
**"Information About Past Beliefs Influences Current Beliefs."**

This project examined how prompting individuals to recall their past beliefs before reading persuasive material could influence how strongly they endorse those beliefs afterward. It was part of my work in the **Social Cognition Lab** with Dr. Michael Wolfe and complemented our studies on belief revision and argumentative writing.

Student Scholars Day offered a supportive environment to share work with students, faculty, and staff outside the psychology department. It also gave me an early chance to practice tailoring my research communication for diverse audiences — a skill that has been invaluable throughout my academic path.
