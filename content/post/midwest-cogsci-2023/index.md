In Spring 2024, I co-presented a research poster at the **American Head and Neck Society (AHNS) Annual Meeting**, based on work conducted during my time as a Clinical Research Coordinator at **Henry Ford Health**.

The poster was titled:  
**"Enhancing PROM Engagement: A Mixed Methods Approach to Reminder Interventions and Patient Preferences in Head and Neck Cancer."**

This project was part of the **BRIGHT Trial**, led by Dr. Samantha Tam, and aimed to identify strategies for improving completion rates and patient satisfaction with electronic patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). My role involved coordinating study visits, managing REDCap data, and contributing to qualitative data synthesis.

This presentation marked my first experience disseminating clinical research at a national conference. It offered an important perspective on translational science, bridging patient-centered care and behavioral health research.

Participating in this work expanded my methodological skills and deepened my appreciation for research that directly impacts patient outcomes.
