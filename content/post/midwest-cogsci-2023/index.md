In Spring 2023, I presented a research poster at the **Midwest Cognitive Science Conference**, expanding on work I had previously shared at the Society for Text and Discourse.

The poster, titled **"Beliefs Influence Argumentative Writing,"** continued our investigation into how belief change following persuasive reading impacts the way people write argumentative essays. This project was part of my ongoing work in the **Social Cognition Lab** at Grand Valley State University, led by Dr. Michael Wolfe.

This conference offered an exciting opportunity to engage with researchers from across the region, share findings in a more interactive format, and refine how I communicated the practical implications of our study. It also marked one of my final undergraduate research milestones before graduating and heading to graduate school.

Events like this helped me solidify my identity as a researcher and gave me valuable experience presenting in academic spaces.
