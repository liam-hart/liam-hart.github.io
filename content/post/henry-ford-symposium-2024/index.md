In Fall 2024, I presented a research poster at the **Henry Ford Health Annual Research Symposium**, based on my work as a Clinical Research Coordinator in the Department of Otolaryngology.

The poster was titled:  
**"Effects of a Brief Cognitive Behavioral Treatment vs Attention Control for Body Image-Related Distress Among Head and Neck Cancer Survivors: A Multi-Site RCT."**

This study was a randomized controlled trial comparing a brief CBT intervention to an attention control condition, aimed at reducing distress related to appearance changes following cancer treatment. I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team across several institutions, contributing to data collection, protocol fidelity, and patient coordination.

Presenting at this internal symposium gave me the chance to share results with clinicians, researchers, and trainees, and to see how local innovations in patient-centered research were making an impact across disciplines.

This experience deepened my interest in clinical trials and behavioral intervention research, especially where psychological science meets real-world application.
