In 2022, I was honored to receive the **Outstanding Creative Achievement Award** from the **Frederik Meijer Honors College** at Grand Valley State University. This award recognized the top five senior capstone projects across the college.

My project was a podcast series titled:  
**"Perspectives on Psilocybin: The Science and Mysticism of Magic Mushrooms."**

The series explored the historical, cultural, and scientific dimensions of psilocybin — from indigenous use and psychedelic therapy to neuroscience and public perception. It blended interviews, academic research, and narrative storytelling to bridge science communication and experiential knowledge.

This capstone project allowed me to combine academic inquiry with creative storytelling, sparking what would later become a deeper interest in **transformative experiences**, **self-defining memory**, and **interdisciplinary communication** — all of which continue to influence my graduate research trajectory.

The award was a meaningful affirmation of the value of creative, public-facing scholarship in psychology and cognitive science.
