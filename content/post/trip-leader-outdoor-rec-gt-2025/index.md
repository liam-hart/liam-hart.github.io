In early 2025, I became a **Trip Leader for Outdoor Recreation at Georgia Tech**, a role that combines outdoor education, leadership development, and community engagement.

As a trip leader, I help plan and guide excursions such as **rock climbing trips**, **day hikes**, and **overnight adventures** across Georgia and the southeastern U.S. The position involves risk management, technical instruction, group facilitation, and logistics — all while fostering inclusivity and confidence in outdoor spaces.

This experience has been both personally meaningful and professionally relevant. It has improved my leadership, adaptability, and communication — qualities that translate well to academic teamwork, teaching, and research coordination. It’s also provided balance and renewal alongside the demands of graduate school.

Outdoor leadership has become a core part of my identity, and I value the opportunity to help others connect with nature, challenge themselves, and grow through shared adventure.
