In Fall 2021, I joined **Psych Friends**, a peer mentoring program in the **Grand Valley State University Department of Psychology**, as an **upper-division psychology major mentor**. This program connects experienced psychology students with those newer to the major to foster academic success, well-being, and a sense of community.

As a mentor, I’ve guided mentees on major requirements, career and education paths in psychology, strategies for academic success, and self-care techniques. I’ve also shared insights on the graduate school application process and helped mentees explore the diverse opportunities within the field of psychology.

Psych Friends has been a fulfilling experience that aligns with my passion for mentorship and community building. It’s been rewarding to support others in navigating their academic journey, just as I was supported when I started mine. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the growth and success of my peers.
