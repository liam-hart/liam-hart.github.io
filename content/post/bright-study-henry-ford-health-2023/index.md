In April 2023, I began working as a **Research Coordinator** at **Henry Ford Health** on the **BRIGHT Study (Building Resilience in Girls' Health Today)** — a large, longitudinal research project examining **mental health, trauma exposure, and resilience** in youth populations.

The BRIGHT Study involves multi-wave data collection, including clinical interviews, cognitive assessments, and biological sampling, with a focus on trauma-exposed girls aged 11–17. As a coordinator, I was responsible for:

- Participant scheduling and informed consent  
- Administering and scoring assessments  
- Managing REDCap data and IRB documentation  
- Coordinating with clinicians, research staff, and school partners  
- Ensuring ethical and culturally sensitive practices

This experience offered firsthand insight into **community-based clinical research** and strengthened my skills in data management, participant rapport, and trauma-informed care. It also affirmed my interest in **lifespan development**, **emotional memory**, and the ways research can inform interventions and public health.

My time on the BRIGHT Study was foundational in preparing for graduate-level work and deepening my commitment to research that supports vulnerable populations.
