In 2025, I began working toward the **Tech to Teaching Certificate** through Georgia Tech’s **Center for Teaching and Learning**. This program provides structured training in **college-level pedagogy**, curriculum development, and evidence-based teaching practices.

The certificate consists of coursework, workshops, and supervised teaching experiences aimed at helping graduate students prepare for future roles as instructors, faculty members, and academic leaders.

My goals for this program are to:
- Strengthen my skills in course planning and classroom communication  
- Apply psychological theory to instructional design  
- Develop inclusive, student-centered teaching practices grounded in research

Completion is expected in 2026, and I’m looking forward to integrating this pedagogical training with my ongoing development as a researcher and mentor. I view teaching as a natural extension of my research — another way to translate psychological science into transformative learning experiences.
