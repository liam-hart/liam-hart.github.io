In Fall 2018, I began my first research experience as an undergraduate student at **Grand Valley State University**, joining the **Exercise Science Lab** during my first year on campus.

The project, titled *“The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output,”* investigated how warm-up interventions influence athletic performance. I contributed to data collection, participant coordination, and experimental setup — all of which gave me early exposure to the scientific method and the collaborative nature of research.

Although my academic interests would later shift toward psychology and cognitive science, this experience was a formative milestone. It helped me build confidence in asking research questions, thinking critically about experimental design, and presenting findings — skills that would become central to my later work in psychology, aging, and memory.

It was also my first experience presenting research publicly at GVSU’s Student Scholars Day in 2019 — an event that helped launch my passion for research communication.
