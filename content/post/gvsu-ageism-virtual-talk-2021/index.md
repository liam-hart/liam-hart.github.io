In Spring 2021, I delivered a **virtual talk** at **Grand Valley State University’s Student Scholars Day**, presenting findings from an independent study on educational interventions for reducing ageism in college students.

The presentation was titled:  
**"Can Ageism Be Reduced by Service Learning Built Into a Lecture-Based Aging Course?"**

The project, conducted under the guidance of Dr. Jing Chen, investigated how a lecture course on aging—when paired with service-learning opportunities—impacted students’ attitudes toward older adults. This research combined my interests in gerontology, education, and social attitudes, and was part of a growing body of work aimed at addressing bias through curriculum design.

This was my first formal presentation focused on aging and intergenerational attitudes, and it helped solidify my interest in aging research and its relevance to real-world social issues. The experience also helped me adapt to presenting in virtual formats — a skill that became essential during the pandemic years.
