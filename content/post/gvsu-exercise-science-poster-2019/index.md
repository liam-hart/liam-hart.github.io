In Spring 2019, during my first year as an undergraduate at Grand Valley State University, I participated in **Student Scholars Day** as a co-author on a research poster in the **Exercise Science Lab**.

The project was titled:  
**"The Effect of Different Pre-Exercise Treatments on Power Output."**

Working under the mentorship of faculty in the Exercise Science program, I helped collect and analyze data examining how various warm-up interventions influenced athletic performance. This early exposure to the research process gave me foundational skills in study design, teamwork, and public presentation â€” all of which proved valuable as I transitioned into cognitive psychology research later in my undergraduate career.

Although outside my current academic focus, this project introduced me to the world of empirical inquiry and shaped my confidence in pursuing more complex research in later years.
