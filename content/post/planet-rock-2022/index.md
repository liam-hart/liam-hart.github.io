After graduating from **Grand Valley State University** in December 2021, I began working at **Planet Rock**, a premier climbing gym in Michigan, starting in **January 2022**.

At Planet Rock, I served as a **staff member and instructor**, where I:
- Welcomed and oriented new climbers  
- Taught belay and safety classes  
- Maintained equipment and facility standards  
- Fostered a supportive, inclusive climbing community

This experience deepened my appreciation for **movement, problem-solving, and community building through climbing**. It also helped me grow in confidence as an educator and communicator â€” skills that continue to benefit my work in academia and leadership roles.

Planet Rock was more than a job; it was a bridge between undergraduate life and my next chapter in research and graduate training.
