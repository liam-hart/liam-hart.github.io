In Spring 2021, I graduated from **Grand Valley State University** with a **Bachelor of Science in Psychology** and a **minor in Applied Statistics**. My time at GVSU was foundational to my academic and research development — both in and out of the classroom.

While at GVSU, I was involved in multiple research projects across psychology and exercise science, earned the **Undergraduate Research Scholar designation**, and completed a **Student Summer Scholars Grant**. I was also honored to receive several awards, including the **Excellence-in-a-Discipline Award**, the **Robert Hendersen Leadership Award**, and **Outstanding Creative Achievement** from the Honors College.

Through these experiences, I discovered my passion for research on belief, cognition, aging, and emotional memory — and developed a long-term interest in combining psychological science with computational methods.

GVSU was where I first learned to design studies, analyze data, present at conferences, and write for publication — and it laid the groundwork for everything that followed in graduate school.
