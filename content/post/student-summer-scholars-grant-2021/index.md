In Summer 2021, I was awarded a **Student Summer Scholars Grant** from the **Office of Undergraduate Research** at **Grand Valley State University**. This competitive award provided funding and mentorship for students conducting independent research.

My funded project, titled  
**"Do Changes in Past Beliefs Influence Current Beliefs?"**,  
was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Michael Wolfe in the **Social Cognition Lab**. It explored how prompting participants to reflect on their prior beliefs before reading persuasive texts impacted their current belief endorsement and argumentative writing.

The grant provided $7,750 in support and included faculty mentorship, presentation opportunities, and professional development workshops. The project culminated in a formal talk at the GVSU Summer Scholars Showcase and served as the foundation for multiple future conference presentations and publications.

This experience was a major stepping stone in my development as a researcher and gave me the confidence and skills that ultimately shaped my path toward graduate school.
