In early 2024, I received an offer of admission to the Psychology Ph.D. program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'll be specializing in Adult Development and Aging, with a focus on cognitive aging, autobiographical memory, and natural language processing.

I’m deeply grateful to be joining the Janus Laboratory, under the mentorship of Dr. Hsiao-Wen Liao. Her work on emotional memory, aging, and narrative structure aligns perfectly with my research interests, and I’m excited to begin contributing to ongoing projects.

This opportunity represents a major turning point in my academic journey and a chance to grow not only as a researcher but also as a teacher and leader in the field of cognitive science.

Stay tuned for future updates as I begin this new chapter in Atlanta!
